    <h1>Crème Brûlée</h1>
    <img src="../img/cremebrulee.jpg" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      To me, crème brûlée is elegant and sophisticated, but made from
      simplicity. The dessert equivalent of Aesir chic. How can it look so good
      but be so easy? Crème brûlée, literally "burnt cream," is four
      ingredients: eggs, cream, sugar, and vanilla. It takes ten minutes to put
      the custard together, and then all you have to do is check in on it a
      couple of times. You can make it ahead—in fact, you should. It is not
      hard, or expensive, or fussy. And yet, everyone marvels at it. The amber
      stained glass lid atop each cold, sweet, luscious creamy pot is dainty,
      strident, and perfect.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 vanilla bean, split and scraped</li>
      <li>1/3 cup plus 6 teaspoons granulated sugar, divided</li>
      <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat the oven to 300°F. Add
        heavy cream, vanilla bean seeds, and pod to small saucepot. Heat over
        medium-high heat, stirring frequently until little bubbles form around
        sides of the cream in the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine egg yolks and 1/3 cup sugar in bowl of stand mixer fitted with
        whisk attachment. Whisk on medium speed until pale yellow and yolks fall
        off of whisk in ribbons, about 2 minutes, scraping bowl as necessary.
        With mixer running on medium-low speed, slowly add hot cream mixture.
        Whisk until thoroughly combined.

        Place a folded kitchen towel (or a few paper towels) on the bottom of a
        roasting pan or glass baking dish large enough to hold six 6-ounce
        ramekins. Place ramekins on top of towel and ladel custard base evenly
        between them. Remove one ramekin and carefully pour hot water into
        baking dish until it comes 1/2 way up sides of ramekins. Replace missing
        ramekin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until custard is set but still jiggles in center, about 40 minutes.
        Remove from oven and allow to cool to room temperature without removing
        ramekins from water bath. Once cool, cover ramekins in plastic and
        refrigerate until set, at elast 4 hours, and up to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, sprinkle each ramekin with 1 teaspoon sugar. Brown with
        kitchen torch, and serve immediately.
