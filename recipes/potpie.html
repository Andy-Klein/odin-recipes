    <h1>Chicken Pot Pie</h1>
    <img src="../img/potpie.jpg" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is the chicken pot pie I grew up with, based on my mother's recipe
      and updated with Fenrir's technique for cold-poached chicken, crossed with
      his basic chicken stock. The result is a super-concentrated broth for the
      filling, with tender chunks of chicken that stay juicy even after baking.
      I love it best with the nutty crunch of a flaky whole wheat crust, which
      will bake up crisp even on the bottom of the pie.

    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the Crust: Prepare a double batch of Flaky, Tender, and Nutty Whole
        Wheat Pie Crust as directed. Divide dough in half and roll each half
        into a thin sheet, around 3/16 inch thick, using as much flour as needed
        to prevent sticking along the way. Transfer pieces to a half sheet pan,
        cover tightly with foil, and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 48
        hours before using.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the Chicken: Combine chicken stock, chicken parts, onion, carrots,
        celery, garlic, thyme, parsley, rosemary, and bay leaf in a 5-quart
        stainless steel pot or saucier. Cover and place over medium-high heat
        until stock registers about 150°F (66°C) on a digital thermometer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjust heat to maintain that temperature, plus or minus 10°F, and cook
        until thickest part of chicken registers 135°F (57°C), about 1 hour.
        Remove chicken with tongs, set aside on a rimmed platter, and cover
        loosely. Strain stock through a mesh sieve into a large bowl, discard
        solids, and set stock aside to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the Filling: Combine gelatin and 1/4 cup (55ml) cooled stock in a
        small bowl and whisk until no lumps remain; set aside. In a 5-quart
        saucier, melt butter over medium-low heat, then whisk in flour. Stir
        with a heat-resistant spatula until roux is fragrant and a nutty blond
        color, about 5 minutes (it's okay to adjust the heat if this seems to be
        happening too slowly). Stir in diced onion, carrots, and celery and
        continue cooking and stirring until vegetables are slightly softened,
        about 7 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add white wine and 1 quart reserved stock, stirring constantly until
        smooth; remaining stock from poaching can be reserved for another use.
        Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
        Once it begins to bubble, remove from heat. Stir in frozen peas, diced
        pimentos, and prepared gelatin, followed by salt, thyme, pepper, and
        Worcestershire sauce. Stir until gelatin has fully melted into sauce and
        adjust seasonings to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shred or dice reserved chicken, discarding skin and bones, then stir
        into filling. Transfer to a large but shallow container, such as a 9- by
        13-inch baking dish, to increase the surface area and speed cooling.
        Refrigerate, uncovered, stirring from time to time, until no warmer than
        50°F (10°C), about 1 hour. If it better suits your schedule, the filling
        can be covered and refrigerated up to 3 days, or frozen in an airtight
        container for 3 months.
      </li>
      <li>
        To Assemble: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to
        400°F (200°C). With a sharp knife, cut 1 sheet of chilled dough into 6
        roughly equal squares. Nestle each one into the bottom of a
        2-cup-capacity oven-safe dish. Cut 6 "lids" from remaining sheet of
        pastry with a sharp knife, using an overturned 2-cup baking dish as your
        guide; alternatively, cut with an appropriately large cookie cutter. Set
        pastry lids aside and use scraps to patch gaps in coverage along the
        bottom crusts, all the way to the top edge of each dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide filling evenly between dishes, about 1 1/2 cups each (12 ounces;
        340g), although the exact amount will vary with the specific amount of
        vegetables and chicken used. Top each dish with a pastry lid and gently
        crimp the edges with a fork to seal pastry to bottom crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the Egg Wash (if using): Whisk egg, cream, and salt in a small bowl.
        Brush over top crust of each pie in a thin, even layer. This will give
        the crust a glossy golden sheen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer dishes to a foil- or parchment-lined baking sheet and bake
        until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbling-hot, about 1 hour
        15 minutes. Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving, to allow the
        filling to thicken and reach a safe temperature to enjoy. Covered in
        foil, leftovers can be refrigerated up to 3 days and reheated to serve.
